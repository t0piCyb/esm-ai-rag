React 19: Separate Client and [server-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/server-components.mdc) 

Client Components allow you to write interactive UI elements that are pre-rendered on the server and can use client-side JavaScript to run in the browser.

## Why Client Components?

1. **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI dynamically.
2. **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, such as geolocation or localStorage, enabling richer functionality.

## Example:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export const Counter=() =>{
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Rules:

1. Client Components need to start with `'use client'`.
2. Client Components can use `useState` and other React hooks.
3. Client Componentsed** on the server, which means that they can create hydration errors. You must avoid such errors by using hooks like `@use-is-client.ts` or checking `typeof window` when using Browser APIs.
