Forms are used to gather data thanks input. You must always follow the rules.

## naming rule

All Forms must start with uppercase and be suffixed by `Form` :

* UserForm
* CreateUserForm
* UpdateUserForm

## rules 
- Be sure that the zod schema exist, if no create it following [zod-schema.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/zod-schema.mdc)

- Then use useZodForm: 
```ts 
import {useZodForm,
} from "@/components/ui/form";

const form = useZodForm({
    schema: NewOrgsSchema,
  });

```
- Use the form and all attributes needed from [form.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/form.tsx)
- The submiting button must be [submit-button.tsx](mdc:src/features/form/submit-button.tsx)
- don't use 
```ts
<Form.Field/>
```
but use 
```ts
import {FormField} from "@/components/ui/form"

<FormField/>
```
as well for FormItem, FormMessage, FormControl, FormLabel

## Code example 

An example of a good form is [new-org-form.tsx](mdc:app/orgs/new/new-org-form.tsx)
